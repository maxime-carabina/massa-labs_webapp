        Massa Ambassadorship Program intends to spread awareness about the Massa Blockchain, its
        Teamâ€™s vision, and decentralization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mission of Masstronauts (Core Ambassadors) & Masscots (Community Ambassadors) is to
        reach those goals - with a qualitative approach more than a quantitative one, however to
        allow as many people as possible to participate, a new episode starting from 0 will allow
        new Masscots to onboard and try their luck at a later date!
      </p>
      <h1>Principlesâ€™ Summary</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>10 to 20 Masscots for each new Cohort</li>
        <li>20+ Masstronauts to manage the Masscots</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>How to join?</h1>
      <p>
        From time to time, a selection will happen to allow new Masscots to join the program. Each
        selection will be done differently.
      </p>
      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p>
        Each Masscot has a minimum amount of tasks to fill in. The more done the more points. It
        included articles, video tutorials, twitter threads, community managementâ€¦ They can be
        graded through our
        <a href="#" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}>
          <span style={{ color: 'var(--color-primary-red)' }}> Crew3 </span>
        </a>
        or different means Massa team would deem appropriate.
      </p>
      <h1>Requirements to apply</h1>
      <p>

        content about Massa, those who are active within the community (community support, committee
        calls participation, AMA questionsâ€¦) are welcome to apply.

      <p>
        Based on the (1) content amount - some content will be graded automatically (2) content
        quality - some content will be reviewed by Masstronauts, a leaderboard will be established.
        We expect quality more than quantity from our Masscots! Therefore the amount of content to
        produce monthly is capped. However, extra content is always noticed and appreciatedâ€¦
      </p>
